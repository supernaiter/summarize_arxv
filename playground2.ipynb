Whispered speech, due to its lower sound pressure compared to normal speech, can be used in semi-silent speech interactions in public places without audible disturbance to others. Converting whispers into normal speech also improves speech quality for people with speech hearing impairments. However, existing speech conversion techniques require speaker-dependent datasets consisting of pairs of whispered and normal speech utterances. To address these limitations, this paper proposes WESPER, a zero-shot real-time whisper-to-normal speech conversion mechanism based on self-supervised learning. WESPER consists of a speech-to-unit (STU) encoder that generates hidden speech units common to whispered and normal speech, and a unit-to-speech (UTS) decoder that reconstructs speech from the encoded speech units. Unlike existing methods, WESPER does not require paired datasets and can perform conversion for any user. Experimental results demonstrate the improved speech quality and preservation of natural prosody achieved by WESPER.

Introduction\\nVoice interaction systems are widely used but can be socially unacceptable or compromise confidentiality in public places. Silent speech input techniques have been developed but often require special sensors and are limited in vocabulary. Whispered speech, which preserves social acceptability in public spaces, has not been widely adopted due to the use of regular microphones.
