It achieves user-independent voice conversion in\\nreal time.\\n\\nABSTRACT\\nRecognizing whispered speech and converting it to normal speech\\ncreates many possibilities for speech interaction. Because the sound\\npressure of whispered speech is significantly lower than that of\\nnormal speech, it can be used as a semi-silent speech interaction in\\npublic places without being audible to others. Converting whispers\\nto normal speech also improves the speech quality for people with\\nspeech or hearing impairments. However, conventional speech con-\\nversion techniques do not provide sufficient conversion quality\\nor require speaker-dependent datasets consisting of pairs of whis-\\npered and normal speech utterances. To address these problems, we\\npropose WESPER, a zero-shot, real-time whisper-to-normal speech\\nconversion mechanism based on self-supervised learning. WESPER\\nconsists of a speech-to-unit (STU) encoder, which generates hidden\\nspeech units common to both whispered and normal speech, and a\\n\\nunit-to-speech (UTS) decoder, which reconstructs speech from the\\nencoded speech units. Unlike the existing methods, this conversion\\nis user-independent and does not require a paired dataset for whis-\\npered and normal speech. The UTS decoder can reconstruct speech\\nin any target speaker’s voice from speech units, and it requires\\nonly an unlabeled target speaker’s speech data. We confirmed that\\nthe quality of the speech converted from a whisper was improved\\nwhile preserving its natural prosody. Additionally, we confirmed\\nthe effectiveness of the proposed approach to perform speech re-\\nconstruction for people with speech or hearing disabilities.\\n\\nCCS CONCEPTS\\n• Human-centered computing → Sound-based input / output;\\nInterface design prototyping; Mobile devices; • Computing method-\\nologies → Neural networks.\\n\\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or\\nclassroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed\\nfor profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation\\non the first page.

In\\naddition, speaking during a conference call can be uncomfortable\\nfor people in the vicinity and can compromise the confidentiality\\nof a conversation.\\n\\nTo overcome these problems, various silent speech input tech-\\nniques have been developed [3, 31, 32, 50, 51, 54]; however, these\\nmethods require special sensors and have not achieved high accu-\\nracy in speech recognition, remaining instead at the level of recog-\\nnizing predefined commands. Conversion of unconditioned silent\\nspeech into normal vocal utterances has also not been achieved.\\n\\nAdditionally, silent speech could be employed to capture utter-\\nances from people with speech or hearing impairments. However,\\nowing to the above-mentioned limitations, existing methods cannot\\nmeet the requirements of practical accessibility aids.\\n\\nIn contrast to silent speech, we focus on whispered speech. Whis-\\npers are sufficiently low in sound pressure to ensure confidentiality,\\nand whispering is almost equivalent to silent speech. Whispering\\ncan be captured with an ordinary microphone and does not require\\nany special sensor configuration. People with speech disorders can\\nstill speak in a whisper or with a hoarse voice, although their vocal\\norgans may have been injured or extracted; thus, their voices might\\nbe recognized.\\n\\nTo address these issues, we propose WESPER, a real-time and\\nzero-shot whisper-to-normal voice conversion method based on\\nself-supervised learning. It is designed to perform speaker inde-\\npendent conversion of whispered speech to normal speech. There\\nis no need for per-user training, and paired datasets of whispered\\nand normal utterances are not required. The proposed architec-\\nture consists of a speech-to-unit (STU) encoder that is pre-trained\\nwith normal and whispered speeches and a unit-to-speech (UTS)\\ndecoder that generates a target voice from speech units (Figure 1).\\nBy pre-training with (unpaired) whisper and normal voices, the\\nSTU can be trained to reduce the difference between normal and\\nwhispered utterances and output a common speech unit.\\n\\nThe UTS decoder can be trained from the speech data of a specific\\nspeaker (without accompanying text labels). If the person’s voice is\\nused, a conversion can be performed to restore the whispered voice\\nto the person’s normal voice, or even to another person’s voice.\\n\\nBecause the encoder and decoder operate in a non-autoregressive\\nmanner, the entire system operates in real-time. Therefore, when\\napplied to teleconferencing, for example, a conference participant\\ncan speak in a whispered voice, which is then converted in real\\ntime, and others can listen to the speech played back in a normal\\nvoice.\\n\\nFigure 2 shows mel-spectrogram examples of whisper-to-normal\\nvoice conversion using the proposed method. More conversion\\nresults are demonstrated in the accompanying video.\\n\\nThe contributions of this study can be summarized as follows.\\n\\nFigure 2: WESPER conversion result: Left: whispered speech;\\nMiddle: whispered speech converted by WESPER; Right:\\nNormal speech by the same speaker, with the same tran-\\nscription\\n\\n• We propose a real-time, speaker-independent, vocabulary-free\\nwhisper-to-normal speech conversion method that can be trained\\nonly on unpaired whispers and normal speech.\\n\\n• The target voice can be learned by voice samples of a specific\\n\\nspeaker without text transcription.\\n\\n• We experimentally confirmed an improvement in performance\\nfor normal speakers and for dysarthric or hearing-impaired\\nspeakers.\\n\\n2 RELATED WORK\\n2.1 Research on Silent and Whispered Speech\\nVarious studies on silent speech have developed methods to rec-\\nognize a user’s silent utterances or silent commands using various\\nsensor configurations, including lip reading, EMG (Electromyogra-\\nphy), and ultrasound [3, 31, 32, 50, 51, 54]. However, these systems\\nrequire a special dataset to perform training, which increases the\\nneed for special sensors and prevents these technologies from be-\\ning widely used. Hence, these systems offer limited vocabulary\\n(less than 100 commands are available, typically around 30). Al-\\nthough silent speech recognition has sometimes been identified as\\na possible approach to help people with dysphonia, these methods\\ncannot interpret unrestricted free speech owing to the vocabulary\\nlimitation.\\n\\nWhispered speech has some similar characteristics to silent\\nspeech, such as preserving social acceptability in public spaces.\\nHowever, it can be more widely adopted, given that ordinary mi-\\ncrophones can be used.\\n\\nSilentVoice [15] is a speech interaction technique that uses in-\\ngressive speech, an utterance made while inhaling. The amplitude\\nof ingressive speech is low, and it can be considered a variation of\\nsilent speech. It requires a microphone-like device placed very close\\nto the mouth, and training is required for users to speak correctly\\nwith ingressive speech. A custom corpus of ingressive speech with\\ntext transcriptions is also required.\\n\\nResearch on whisper voice recognition [6, 11, 14, 18] has previ-\\nously been conducted. The Alexa smart speaker supports a whisper\\nmode [23]. In this mode, when a user whispers to Alexa, Alexa\\nresponds in a whisper [10].\\n\\nDualVoice [48] has also been proposed as a method to per-\\nform end-to-end recognition of whispered voices based on a self-\\nsupervised speech recognition system based on wav2vec2.0 [2]\\nand HuBERT [21]. They also proposed an interaction technique to\\n\\nWhisperWESPER convertedWhisperNormalsecsecsecHz\\x0cWESPER: Zero-shot and Realtime Whisper to Normal Voice Conversion for Whisper-based Speech Interactions\\n\\nCHI ’23, April 23–28, 2023, Hamburg, Germany\\n\\nmodel\\n\\ntraining data\\n\\nper-user dataset\\n\\nconversion to\\nnormal voice\\n\\n(whisper)\\nspeech recognition\\n\\nsilent speech\\nex.[3, 31, 32, 50, 51, 54]\\n\\nspecial paired-dataset for\\ndedicated sensors\\n\\nrequired\\n\\nParotoron [4]\\n\\npaired whisper-normal voice\\n\\nrequired\\n\\nDualVoice [48]\\n\\nSilentVoice [15]\\n\\nCycleGAN-VC [30]\\n\\nMSpeC-Net [37]\\n\\nAGAN-W2SC [16]\\n\\nWESPER (ours)\\n\\nlabeled, unpaired\\nwhisper and normal voice\\nlabeled\\nsilentvoice (custom)\\nunpaired, unlabeled\\nwhisper and normal voice\\npaired\\nwhisper-normal voice\\npaired\\nwhisper-normal voice\\nunpaired and unlabeled\\nwhisper and normal voice\\n\\nrequired\\n\\nrequired\\n\\nnot required\\n\\nrequired\\n\\nrequired\\n\\nnot required\\n\\nboth\\n\\nYES\\n\\nNO\\n\\nNO\\n\\nYES\\n\\nYES\\n\\nYES\\n\\nYES\\n\\nTable 1: Research on silent and whispered speech\\n\\nYES\\n(commands, or characters)\\nYES\\n(through voice conversion)\\n\\nYES\\n\\nYES\\n\\nNO\\n\\nNO\\n\\nNO\\n\\nYES\\n(through voice conversion)\\n\\ndistinguish between whispered and normal utterances. WESPER\\ncan be combined with DualVoice to selectively convert a user’s\\nwhispered voice.\\n\\n2.2 Speech Conversion\\nNormal speech conversion technologies have been developed to\\nconvert one voiced utterance to another [19, 29, 30, 43, 46]; however,\\nthe conversion quality of these methods remains unsatisfactory\\nwhen applied to whisper-to-normal voice conversion.\\n\\nRecently, several machine learning-based whisper-to-normal\\nvoice conversion techniques have been investigated [41]. To com-\\npare these techniques, it is important to consider the quality of\\nconversion and the required characteristics of the dataset used\\nfor training. A paired whisper-normal voice dataset (i.e. a dataset\\ncontaining both whispered and normal versions of the same utter-\\nance) or a labeled whispered voice dataset (i.e. a dataset containing\\nwhispered utterances accompanied by text labels) will require a\\nsignificant amount of effort to prepare. Conversely, if an un-paired\\nand un-labeled whisper voice dataset is used (i.e. a dataset containing\\nonly whisper utterances without corresponding normal versions\\nor labels), the effort required to prepare the dataset is low.\\n\\nAttention-guided generative adversarial network for whisper to\\nnormal speech conversion (AGAN-W2SC) is a GAN-based whisper\\nto normal speech conversion [16]. It converts a whispered voice\\nrepresented as mel-spectrogram into the corresponding normal\\nspeech’s mel-spectrogram. It is based on GAN, and the attention-\\nmap is used for the conversion. It requires a paired whisper-normal\\nspeech dataset. MSpeC-Net [37] is an autoencoder-based multi-\\ndomain voice conversion and supports whisper-to-normal conver-\\nsion. It also requires a paired whisper-normal voice dataset.\\n\\nMoreover, whispered speech can be converted to text using\\nspeech recognition and generate normal speech using text-to-speech\\nmethods [22]. However, this approach requires a labeled dataset\\n\\nfor whispered speech recognition, and prosodic information con-\\ntained in whispered utterances is lost because the intermediate text\\nrepresentation does not convey such information.\\n\\nParrotron [4] is a speech conversion system designed to im-\\nprove the speech of speakers with dysplasia. It is based on an\\nencoder-decoder model that conforms to the text-to-speech system,\\nTacotron [58]; however, it differs from Tacotron in that both the\\ninput and output data are formatted as mel-spectrograms. It also re-\\nquires paired source and target speeches, making the construction\\nof the required dataset relatively difficult.\\n\\nPhonetic posteriorgrams (PPGs) [55] are intermediate informa-\\ntion obtained from automatic speech recognition. PPGs can be\\nused for many-to-one speaker conversion because they represent\\nthe articulation of spoken content speaker independently. To our\\nknowledge, the effects of PPGs on whispered voice have not been\\ninvestigated. Our method also uses intermediated speech units, but\\nit does not require text-based corpus as in the case of automatic\\nspeech recognition (ASR) and PPGs.\\n\\nIn contrast, our proposed system requires only samples of un-\\npaired target and source speech, and it does not require accompa-\\nnying text transcriptions, thus making datasets easy to prepare and\\nindependent of the target language.\\n\\nThe characteristics of related technologies are summarized in\\nTable 1. We also demonstrate whisper to normal conversion exam-\\nples including NMSE-DiscoGAN [53], MSpeC-Net [37], CycleGAN-\\nVC [30], AGAN-W2SC [16], and WESPER at https://wesperproj.\\ngithub.io/.\\n\\n2.3 Self Supervised Representation Learning\\n\\nfor Speech\\n\\nRecently, combining pre-training with self-supervised representa-\\ntion learning on unlabeled speech data and fine-tuning on labeled\\nspeech data has attracted attention. These systems are primarily\\n\\n\\x0cCHI ’23, April 23–28, 2023, Hamburg, Germany\\n\\nJ.Rekimoto\\n\\nintended for speech recognition applications, but they have also\\nbeen applied to perform speaker, language, and emotion recogni-\\ntion [44, 59].\\n\\nIn particular, the pre-training method of hidden-unit BERT (hu-\\nBERT) [21] is similar to that of the masked language model used in\\nbidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) [12]\\nin natural language processing. It is designed to mask part of the\\ninput and estimate the corresponding expression features from the\\nrest of the input. With this pre-training, the model can learn the\\nacoustic properties of the input data and the characteristics of the\\nspeech.\\n\\nFor use as ASR, after pre-training, fine-tuning is performed on\\nonly a small amount of the audio data with text transcriptions. A\\nprojection layer and a connectionist temporal classification (CTC)\\nlayer [17] has been added to generate text transcriptions from audio\\nwaveforms.\\n\\nAs reported in [2, 59], self-supervised ASR achieved a speech\\nrecognition accuracy comparable to conventional state-of-the-art\\nASRs with fine-tuning only on a small amount of labeled speech\\ndata. Therefore, this architecture could be suitable for recogniz-\\ning whispered voice recognition with limited whispered speech\\ncorpora.\\n\\nWESPER is unique in that it uses pre-training to reduce the dif-\\nference between the latent vectors encoding whispered and normal\\nutterances.\\n\\n2.4 Textless-NLP\\nRecently, text-free speech processing and speech conversion meth-\\nods have been developed. Through self-supervised learning, these\\nsystems derive latent representations from speech data that is not\\naccompanied by text transcriptions. Textless-NLP[34, 35] and Au-\\ndioLM [5] do not use text transcriptions or phoneme symbols in\\nspeech processing systems; they use discrete units constructed by\\nself-supervised learning. Soft discrete unit is another approach for\\ntextless speech processing [57].\\n\\nOur proposed method also uses non-discrete vectors as latent\\nspeech representations obtained from self-supervised learning and\\ndoes not explicitly use text transcriptions or phoneme symbols.\\nOur research is unique because we demonstrate that whispered and\\nnormal speech can be represented by similar speech units through\\nself-supervised learning. In addition, our method is also designed\\nto work seamlessly with a speech generation system in the later\\nstages.\\n\\n3 THE WESPER VOICE CONVERSION MODEL\\nWESPER consists of an STU encoder and a UTS decoder. The STU\\nconverts whispered or normal speech into common speech units.\\nThe UTS converts common speech units into mel-spectrograms\\nthat can be reconstructed as speech by a vocoder. WESPER is char-\\nacterized by the fact that the common speech units of the same\\nutterance can be similar, although the STU is only pretrained with\\n(un-paired) whispered and normal speech, and it is not trained with\\na paired set of whispered and normal utterances. The details of\\neach and the method used to train the model are described below.\\n\\nFigure 3: Overview of STU pre-training. Unpaired whis-\\npered or normal speech is used for pretraining. The trans-\\nformer layer is trained by estimating discrete units from the\\nmasked input. The projection layer after the transformer\\nlayers generates 256-dimensional vectors (one every 20 ms),\\nwhich are used as common speech units.\\n\\n3.1 Speech-to-Unit (STU) Encoder\\nThe STU encoder takes audio waveform as the input and outputs\\nunits. It is based on HuBERT [21], a self-supervised neural network\\nfor speech, which pre-trains a large amount of unlabeled speech in a\\nBERT [12]-like manner; it learns to recover the relevant parts from\\npartially masked speech features and thereby acquires a speech-\\nlanguage model.\\n\\nFor our purpose, we want to generate speech units that are as\\nidentical as possible between whispered and normal speech. To\\nachieve this, we pre-trained an STU with a mixture of whispered\\nand normal speech utterances; we used normal English speech with\\nmany speakers from the Librispeech 960h dataset [42]. Librispeech\\nspeech data were mechanically converted to a whispered voice us-\\ning an LPC-based audio conversion tool [60]. Additionally, we used\\nthe wTIMIT speech dataset of normal and whispered speech [36]\\nwith a speech length of 58 h.\\n\\nFigure 3 shows the pre-training process of the STU in detail. Only\\nthe unpaired whispered or normal speech is used for pre-training.\\nThe transformer layer is trained by estimating discrete units from\\nthe masked input. Similar to HuBERT, the discrete target units are\\nfirst generated by k-means clustering of the input speech data in\\nthe first stage, and then by k-means clustering of the outputs of\\nthe transformer intermediate layer. In our experiment, we used 100\\ndiscrete units. The projection layer after the transformer layers\\ngenerates a sequence of 256-dimensional vectors (one per 20 ms),\\nwhich are used as common speech units.\\n\\nIn the STU, 12 transformer layers are placed in front of the\\nCNN feature extractor (Figure 1). After pre-training, by comparing\\nthe output from each layer, we confirmed that (1) the difference\\n\\nTransformer Layer 11Transformer Layer 12Projection[LEN, 768][LEN, 256]Label Embedding[256, K][LEN, K][LEN]Cross-Entropy LossCosine-similarity(To Unit to Speech) CNN EncoderWhisper / Normal voices(un-paired)Transformer Layer 1MaskingAcoustic unit discovery(e.g., K-Means on MFCC or HuBERTintermediate layer)Common Speech UnitK Discrete units(K=100)Predict hidden units at masked locations25620ms\\x0cWESPER: Zero-shot and Realtime Whisper to Normal Voice Conversion for Whisper-based Speech Interactions\\n\\nCHI ’23, April 23–28, 2023, Hamburg, Germany\\n\\nIn addition, we can fine-tune the STU with (transcript-attached)\\nwTIMIT and Librispeech datasets by adding a CTC layer [17] as\\nin [48]; therefore, STU could be used as an ASR to recognize whis-\\npered and normal speeches.\\n\\n3.2 UTS Decoder\\nThe UTS decoder takes the speech units generated by the STU as the\\ninput and reconstructs the target (normal) speech. It is based on the\\nnon-autoregressive text-to-speech (TTS) system FastSpeech2 [49].\\nWhile the original FastSpeech2 includes an embedding layer that\\ntakes text or phoneme tokens and transforms them into a sequence\\nof vector embeddings, we can eliminate this layer because UTS\\ntakes speech units as direct input. The original FastSpeech2 also\\nincludes a duration estimator that estimates the duration of each\\nphoneme token and a length regulator that adjusts the number of\\ninternal vectors according to the estimated duration. These parts\\ncan also be eliminated for our purpose because the STU generates\\nspeech units at a constant rate.\\n\\nWhen learning the original FastSpeech2, it was necessary to pro-\\nvide the duration of each phoneme in the corpus as a ground truth\\nby an external tool such as Montreal Forced Aligner [38]. Because\\nof this limitation, FastSpeech2’s learning is language-dependent.\\nConversely, UTS does not require duration estimation, and UTS\\ncan be language-independent.\\n\\nThe output of UTS is a mel-spectrogram, as in FastSpeech2.\\nA vocoder (HiFi-GAN [33]) converts this into an actual speech\\nwaveform.\\n\\nIn a regular TTS system, the target speech and the corresponding\\ntext labels are needed for training. By contrast, the proposed UTS\\nrequires only the target speech and no text labels. The target speech\\nis passed through the STU to obtain a sequence of speech units\\nassociated with the speech waveform and used to train the UTS\\n(Figure 6). In our experiment, the UTS was trained using speech\\ndata from a single speaker of LJSpeech [27], and data from other\\nspeakers taken from narration data.\\n\\n4 SYSTEM CONFIGURATION\\nWe designed the WESPER model using the PyTorch framework.\\nThe STU is based on HuBERT, and the UTS is based on a modified\\nimplementation of FastSpeech2 PyTorch implementation by [8]. We\\nused Librispeech and wTIMIT (both of which include normal and\\nwhispered speech) for pre-training. With a dual NVIDIA R6000,\\npre-training took 48 h. UTS training took 26 h for each target voice.\\nThe total processing time required to perform the conversion\\nwas approximately 1/20th of the actual speech duration on a single\\nNVIDIA R6000 and 1/10th on an Apple M1 Max CPU. The actual\\nquality of the conversion is demonstrated in the attached video.\\n\\nWe designed two types of interfaces. The first operated in a\\npush-to-talk style, where the user first speaks in a whispered or\\nnormal voice while pressing a button. Thereafter, when the but-\\nton is released, the speech waveform recorded during that time is\\nsent to the speech-conversion neural networks, and the result is\\nimmediately played back. The other detected a non-audio period of\\ninput speech and automatically converted speech segments without\\nadditional user input.\\n\\nFigure 4: Comparison of whispered/normal voice differ-\\nences: The comparison is made using normal speech and\\nspeech with whispering transformations. (Above) An STU\\npre-trained with normal and whispered speeches produced\\nfewer differences than that pre-trained with normal speech\\nonly. As the transformer layer deepens, the difference be-\\ntween the two decreases. (Middle) There was a difference\\nin the mel-spectrogram, which decreased with the speech\\nunits. (Bottom) UMAP [39] visualizations of differences be-\\ntween whisper and normal voices in mel-spectrogram and\\nspeech-unit’s space.\\n\\nin speech unit values between whispered and normal voices de-\\ncreased with increasing layer depth; (2) the difference decreased\\nwhen the STU was pre-trained with both whispered and normal\\nspeech utterances compared to pre-training with normal speech\\nonly (Figure 4). Figure 4 (bottom) also shows the UMAP [39] vi-\\nsualization of whispered and normal speech in mel-spectrogram\\nspace and common speech unit space. The corresponding periods\\nof two speeches are connected by lines. As shown in the figure, the\\ndifferences are reduced in the common speech unit space (except\\nfor a few long distances).\\n\\nAlthough the speech feature values of whispered and normal\\nvoices are different, we assume this is addressed through the self-\\nsupervised pre-training so that utterances with similar linguistic\\nstandpoints are represented with similar units. We speculate that\\nour learning method can extract common pronunciations from both\\nnormal and whispered utterances, similar to how self-supervised\\npre-training methods can extract common pronunciations from the\\nutterances of different speakers in an ASR system.\\n\\nCNN Encoder012341112Output from transformer intermediate layersSTU pretrained with normal voicesSTUpretrained with whispered and normal voices121086420Mean vector differenceWhisper / Normal voicesTransformer Layer 1Transformer Layer 2Transformer Layer 3Transformer Layer 4Transformer Layer 11Transformer Layer 12DifferencereductionNormalWhisperdiffMel-spectrogramSpeech UnitsMel-spectrogramSpeech unit\\x0cCHI ’23, April 23–28, 2023, Hamburg, Germany\\n\\nJ.Rekimoto\\n\\nFigure 5: Comparison of FastSpeech2 [49] and UTS decoders:\\nFastSpeech2 needs to predict the duration of each phoneme,\\nwhereas UTS accepts a common speech unit with the same\\nduration.

Figure 8 (a) shows the re-\\nsults of the MOS evaluation. The WESPER-converted voice showed\\na score between that of normal and whispered voices. It was con-\\nfirmed that WESPER conversion improved the MOS of the original\\nwhispered speech (𝑝 < 0.01 by pairwise t-test, Cohen’s d effect\\nsize = 0.54). Figure 8 (b) shows the responses to the question “Is\\nthis voice hoarse or normal?” and there is a clear improvement in\\nthe voices converted with WESPER (𝑝 < 0.01). Figure 8 (c) shows\\nthe responses to the question “Is the voice using consistent artic-\\nulation, standard intonation, and prosody?” Here, WESPER and\\nwhisper showed almost equal results. Notably, WESPER did not\\naffect the naturalness of the prosody. Considering the speech con-\\nverted by WESPER is generated by the unit-to-speech module and\\nthe vocoder, this result indicates that WESPER can preserve the\\nnatural prosody of the original speech.\\n\\nMultiple Stimuli with Hidden Reference and Anchor (MUSHRA) eval-\\nuation.

For each rating, participants can play\\neach voice as many times as they like. Because of the presence of\\nanchor and hidden reference audio, MUSHRA is considered more\\nreliable than MOS.\\n\\nWe recruited 50 gender-balanced, English-speaking participants\\nover the age of 18 via the Internet using the Prolific crowdsourcing\\nsystem [25]. We used a javascript-based MUSHRA testing tool [28]\\nfor online evaluation (Figure 9, the system is available from https:\\n//github.com/rkmt/mushraJS_prolific ). We used the same whisper-\\nnormal voice samples as in the previous MOS test. The participants’\\nresponses are collected over the Internet.\\n\\nThe results are presented in Figure 10. It revalidates the results\\nof the MOS evaluation (𝑝 < 0.01 through pairwise t-test, effect size\\n= 0.57).\\n\\nAccording to these evaluations, we can draw the following con-\\n\\nclusions:\\n\\n• WESPER can convert whispered voices to normal voices.\\n• Speechdata converted with WESPER had a better MOS than the\\n\\nwhispered source voice.\\n\\nFigure 9: An example of MUSHRA evaluation web inter-\\nfaces.\\n\\n**n.s.(a)(b)(c)\\x0cCHI ’23, April 23–28, 2023, Hamburg, Germany\\n\\nJ.Rekimoto\\n\\nFigure 10: Speech quality evaluation between whispered and\\nWESPER converted voices by MUSHRA (MUltiple Stimuli\\nwith Hidden Reference and Anchor). (*: 𝑝 < 0.01, t-test)\\n\\n• WESPER preserved the natural prosody of the source whispered\\n\\nvoice.\\n\\n5.2 Speech Recognition Accuracy\\nThere are two possible ways to use WESPER as a speech recognizer,\\nincluding speech recognition with WESPER and recognition of\\nspeech converted with WESPER by other speech recognizers.\\n\\nIn the former method, a WESPER model (based on HuBERT) pre-\\ntrained with whispered and normal speech is fine-tuned using the\\nwhispered corpus, and text is inferred from the whispered voice. In\\nthe latter case, the whispered speech converted by WESPER can con-\\ntrol any other speech-enabled device. If the whispered speech can\\nbe converted to normal speech, then the existing speech-enabled\\ndevices can be used immediately without the need to modify them\\nfor whispered speech.\\n\\nUsing the existing speech recognizer (google cloud speech-to-\\ntext [24]) as a reference, we measured the speech recognition accu-\\nracy of normal speech, whispered speech, and whispered speech\\nconverted by WESPER.\\n\\nThe wTIMIT corpus was used for the measurements. wTIMIT\\nis a TIMIT-compliant transcription containing both normal and\\nwhispered speech with labels. This corpus evaluated the recogni-\\ntion accuracy of whispered speech converted by WESPER using\\nthe recognition accuracy of normal and whispered speech as the\\nbaseline.\\n\\nThe results are summarized in Table 2 in terms of word error\\nrate (WER) and character error rate (CER), as well as bilingual eval-\\nuation understudy (BLEU). As shown in the table, the recognition\\naccuracy was not high when whispered speech was directly rec-\\nognized (WER=44.70%), but the accuracy improved (WER=26.68%)\\nafter conversion with WESPER.\\n\\nWhen tested with wTIMIT(W), HuBERT-base pre-trained with\\nLibrispeech and wTIMIT(N,W) shows better results than the google\\ncloud speech-to-text (HuBERT: WER=33.06%, Google: WER=44.70%).\\nIt is speculated that the effect of pre-training with a mixture of whis-\\npered and normal speech (but without fine-tuning with whispered\\nvoice) may contribute to the accuracy of ASR.\\n\\nFigure 11: Speech quality evaluation for people with speech\\ndisorders ranked by 5-point MOS: (*: 𝑝 < 0.01, **: 𝑝 < 0.05,\\nS1-S5: speakers, VFP: Vocal Fold Polyps, SD: Spasmodic Dys-\\nphonia)\\n\\nFigure 12: Speech quality evaluation for people with vocal\\ndisabilities ranked by MUSHRA. (*: 𝑝 < 0.01, S1-S5: speakers,\\nVFP: Vocal Fold Polyps, SD: Spasmodic Dysphonia)\\n\\nNotably, WESPER is not trained with a labeled corpus. It is pre-\\ntrained with whispered and normal speeches, which improves the\\nspeech recognition accuracy.\\n\\nTherefore, speech recognition via WESPER conversion does not\\nrequire the preparation of a corpus of whispered speech for specific\\nor unspecified speakers.\\n\\n5.3 Evaluations on Speech Reconstruction for\\n\\nPeople with Speech Disorders\\n\\nAn important goal of WESPER is the reconstruction of atypical\\nspeech of people with speech disorders or hearing impairments.\\nThis makes their speech more understandable to people who are\\nnot familiar with their individual speech patterns.\\n\\nDysphonia is an involuntary hoarse, breathy, or strained sound-\\ning voice or low volume or pitch. There are various causes, including\\nspasms, polyps of the vocal tract, and other causes. If the vocal cords\\nhave been removed because of throat cancer or other causes, the\\nvoice becomes extremely difficult to produce. For hearing impair-\\nment, even if the vocal cords are not affected, the control of the\\nvocal cords becomes difficult, resulting in dysphonia.

Figure 11\\nshows the results in terms of MOS. For both SD and VFP, WESPER-\\nconverted voices had higher MOS scores (𝑝 < 0.01, effect size=0.66)\\nand MUSHRA scores (𝑝 < 0.01, effect size=0.79). Figure 13 shows\\nthe responses to the question “Is this voice hoarse or normal?”\\nand there is a clear improvement in the WESPER-converted voices\\ncompared to the original VFP and SD voices (𝑝 < 0.01). Figure 14\\nshows the answers to the question “Does the voice use consistent\\narticulation, standard intonation, and prosody?”. Here, WESPER-\\nconverted and original voices showed nearly equal scores, although\\nWESPER-converted voices showed slightly better scores. It can be\\nassumed that WESPER did not affect the prosody of the original\\nspeech.\\n\\nAccording to these evaluations, we can make the following con-\\n\\nclusions.\\n• WESPER-converted voices of people with VFP and SD speech\\ndisabilities showed better quality. This suggests that WESPER\\ncan improve the quality of the speech of people with these con-\\nditions in terms of its intelligibility by people unfamiliar with\\ntheir individual speech patterns.\\n\\n• Similarly, WESPER can improve the naturalness of original VFP\\n\\nand SD speech.\\n\\n• WESPER could also preserve the natural prosody of the source\\n\\nspeech.\\n\\nNotably, this test was performed on German sentences. Although\\nthe WESPER pre-training was performed only on English speech\\nand not on German speech, the prosody of the source speech was\\npreserved and its MOSs were improved. Therefore, this result may\\ndemonstrate the language-independence ability of the WESPER\\nmodel. The attached video shows an example of whisper to normal\\nconversion in Japanese. Because wav2vec 2.0, the base model for\\nSTU, has also shown language-independent pre-training perfor-\\nmance [9], the language-independent ability of WESPER could be\\na feature worth evaluating in the future.\\n\\n5.4 Speech Reconstruction Evaluation for\\nPeople with Hearing Impairment\\n\\nFinally, we evaluated the effect of speech reconstruction by WES-\\nPER for people with hearing impairments. People with hearing loss\\ncannot hear their own speech and that of others; therefore, they\\ntend to have difficulty speaking in a way that is easily understood\\nby general speakers. However, because their vocal organs are nor-\\nmal, their speech has different characteristics from that of people\\nwith dysphasia.\\n\\nWe used the “corpus of deaf speech for acoustic and speech\\nproduction research” [40]. Utterances of five speakers (one was a\\nhearing speaker and the other four were hearing impaired) were\\nused. We recruited 50 evaluation participants using Prolific [25],\\nwho were evenly balanced in terms of gender, fluent English speak-\\ners, and over the age of 18. We asked the participants to perform a\\n5-point ranking of each utterance in terms of MOS, hoarse-normal,\\nand natural prosody.\\n\\nThe results are presented in Figures 15, 16, 17, and 18. These\\nresults indicate that MOS, MUSHRA, and other rating scores were\\n\\nFigure 13: Hoarse-Normal assessments of utterances by peo-\\nple with speech disorders (*: 𝑝 < 0.01).\\n\\nFigure 14: Speech prosody consistency of utterances by peo-\\nple with speech disorders. (n.s.: not significant)\\n\\npeople with vocal cord damage, but the sound produced is artificial,\\nthe pitch conversion is deterministic, and there is a large devia-\\ntion from normal vocalization. The communication deficit caused\\nby dysphonia is a serious problem, and its elimination by voice\\nconversion technology should be of great social value.\\n\\nTo investigate the quality of the improvement by WESPER voice\\nconversion, we evaluated the speech utterances of people with two\\ntypes of speech disorders, as described below.\\n\\nVocal Fold Polyps (we will refer as VFPs): VFPs are among the\\nmost common benign lesions of the larynx, affecting the quality\\nof voice production.\\n\\nSpasmodic Dysphonia (we will refer as SD): This is also called\\nlaryngeal dystonia, SD is another common neurological disorder\\nthat affects voice and speech. It is a lifelong condition that causes\\nspasms of the muscles that produce the voice.\\n\\nWe used the Saarbruecken Voice Database (SVD) corpus [1, 45]\\nto sample utterances from people with VFP and SD. The SVD is a\\ncommonly used corpus of voices of people with speech disorders. It\\ncontains recordings of vowel utterances and a recording of the Ger-\\nman reference sentence “Guten Morgen, wie geht es Ihnen?” (“Good\\nmorning, how are you?”). This sentence was used for evaluation.\\nFifty participants were recruited for the evaluation using the\\nProlific [25]. The recruited participants were evenly balanced in\\nterms of gender and were all over the age of 18.

The re-\\nsults of the evaluation experiments indicated that the degree of\\nimprovement in the speech of people with hearing impairments\\nwas less than that of the speech of people with dysphasia. There-\\nfore, we assume that the former has significant prosodic varia-\\ntions. Although the primary purpose of this study was to achieve\\nspeaker-independent speech conversion by pre-training alone, we\\nplan to conduct additional experiments to investigate whether the\\nconversion performance can be improved by applying small-scale\\nfine-tuning to each speaker.\\n\\nEven in this case, we believe that speech pairs are necessary,\\nbut text transcription is not required. A pair of whispered and\\nhoarse speech utterances and normal speech converted to a com-\\nmon speech unit by STU can be used instead of text transcription,\\nas in the case of ASR fine-tuning.\\n\\nAudio Input Device Suitable for Whispered Speech. As demonstrated\\nin this study, whispered or hoarse voices can be converted into\\nnormal voices. In practice, the selection of an appropriate audio\\ninput device would be important. We are currently testing our\\nproposed approach with normal headsets and a directional array\\nmicrophone (designed for smart speakers), and have obtained good\\nresults. For wearable devices, a non-audible murmur (NAM) mi-\\ncrophone that detects skin vibrations could be used for inaudible\\nutterances [20]. Combining with noise reduction techniques such\\nas [7, 61] is another important future direction.\\n\\nPhilips and Dyson are also developing masks that provide pow-\\nered respiratory ventilation to protect against air pollution and\\ninfectious diseases [13, 26]. A microphone can be placed inside\\nsuch masks to pick up a whispered voice, which would give an\\neffect almost equivalent to silent speech.\\n\\nHuman-AI Integration. This research concerns machine-learning\\ntechniques for converting the whispered speech of unspecified\\nspeakers into normal speech. In practice, however, we established\\nthat users noticed that some similar whispered utterances were\\neasily converted to normal speech, whereas others were difficult.\\nThey tried to speak by relying on machine learning on the user\\n\\nFigure 16: Speech quality evaluation for people with hear-\\ning impairment: Speech quality was ranked by MUSHRA.\\n(S1’-S4’: speakers, **: 𝑝 < 0.05)\\n\\nFigure 17: Hoarse-Normal assessments of utterances by peo-\\nple with hearing impairment.

Therefore, these results indicate that people with hearing\\nloss may have difficulty controlling prosody while speaking.\\n\\n**********n.s.n.s.****************n.s.n.s.\\x0cWESPER: Zero-shot and Realtime Whisper to Normal Voice Conversion for Whisper-based Speech Interactions\\n\\nCHI ’23, April 23–28, 2023, Hamburg, Germany\\n\\nSpeaker Type\\n\\nNormal\\nWhisper\\nWESPER[Whisper]\\n\\nMOS MUSHRA Q1\\n4.16\\n90.01\\n4.15\\n2.90\\n51.33\\n3.27\\n3.97\\n63.64\\n3.79\\n\\nVFP\\n\\nSD\\n\\nS1\\nWESPER[S1]\\nS2\\nWESPER[S2]\\nS3\\nWESPER[S3]\\nS4\\nWESPER[S4]\\nS5\\nWESPER[S4]\\n\\nSpeakers with speech disorders\\n19.13\\n35.72\\n36.66\\n57.53\\n42.19\\n62.74\\n27.51\\n44.45\\n49.86\\n65.53\\n35.20\\n53.30\\n\\n2.72\\n3.42\\n3.08\\n3.96\\n3.20\\n4.12\\n2.24\\n2.88\\n3.54\\n3.94\\n2.93\\n3.64\\n\\nAll\\nWESPER[All]\\n\\n1.54\\n3.78\\n2.20\\n4.16\\n2.00\\n4.36\\n1.20\\n3.36\\n2.68\\n3.90\\n1.93\\n3.89\\n\\nQ2\\n3.99\\n3.31\\n3.43\\n\\n3.00\\n3.24\\n3.40\\n3.76\\n3.26\\n3.60\\n2.36\\n2.20\\n3.54\\n3.64\\n3.12\\n3.29\\n\\nNormal\\nS1’\\nWESPER[S1’]\\nS2’\\nWESPER[S2’]\\nS3’\\nWESPER[S3’]\\nS4’\\nWESPER[S4’]\\nAll\\nWESPER[All]\\n\\nSpeakers with hearing impaired\\n91.75\\n43.05\\n47.47\\n20.76\\n20.05\\n28.30\\n35.07\\n35.86\\n41.23\\n32.07\\n36.21\\n\\n3.68\\n2.30\\n2.61\\n1.61\\n1.93\\n2.03\\n2.39\\n2.38\\n3.06\\n2.08\\n2.50\\nMean Opinion Score\\nMUltiple Stimuli with Hidden Reference and Anchor\\n‘Is this voice hoarse or normal?’\\n\\n3.75\\n2.51\\n2.97\\n1.84\\n2.55\\n2.22\\n2.93\\n2.59\\n3.35\\n2.12\\n2.36\\n\\n3.76\\n2.29\\n2.38\\n1.74\\n2.06\\n2.19\\n2.39\\n2.26\\n2.62\\n2.28\\n2.94\\n\\n‘Is the voice use consistent articulation,\\nstandard intonation and prosody?’\\n\\nMOS\\nMUSHRA\\nQ1\\n\\nQ2\\n\\nWESPER[•] WESPER converted •\\nVFP\\nSD\\nS1-S5, S1’-S4’\\n\\nVocal Fold Polyps speakers\\nSpasmodic Dysphonia speakers\\nspeaker IDs\\n\\nTable 3: Summary of Voice Conversion Quality Evaluation\\n(MUSHRA: 100-point score, others:5-point score)\\n\\nside.

This\\ncan be seen as an actual example of human-AI integration [47]\\nthrough vocalization.\\n\\n7 CONCLUSION\\nIn this study, we proposed WESPER as a mechanism for the real-\\ntime conversion of whispered speech into normal speech. We con-\\nfirmed that a common speech unit can be obtained by self-supervised\\nlearning even when the acoustic features of whispered and nor-\\nmal speech are different. Speech reproduction can be learned from\\nspeech data of arbitrary target speakers only without using text\\n\\nlabels. There is no need to train for each user, nor is there a need\\nfor parallel data for whispered and normal speech. From speech\\nunits, WESPER can reconstruct utterances of any target speaker and\\nrequires only unlabeled speech data from target speakers. We con-\\nfirmed that the quality of the converted speech is improved and that\\nthe prosody of the speech is preserved. Additionally, we reported\\nan evaluation of the results of reconstructing speech utterances of\\npeople with speech disorders and hearing impairments.\\n\\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\\nWe are grateful to the reviewers for their valuable comments.

      "{'title': 'WESPER: Zeroshot Realtime Whisper-to-Normal Voice Conversion for Whisper-based Speech Interactions', 'author': ['Jun Rekimoto'], 'jornal/conference': 'CHI ’ 23', 'year': '2023', 'abstract': 'Recognizing whispered speech and converting it to normal speech creates many possibilities for speech interaction. Because the sound pressure of whispered speech is significantly lower than normal speech, it can be used for semi-silent speech interaction in public places without being audible to others. Converting whispers to normal speech also improves speech quality for people with speech and hearing impairments. However, conventional speech conversion techniques do not provide sufficient conversion quality and require speaker-dependent datasets consisting of pairs of whispered and normal speech utterances. To address these problems, we propose WESPER, a zero-shot, real-time whisper-to-normal speech conversion mechanism based on self-supervised learning.
